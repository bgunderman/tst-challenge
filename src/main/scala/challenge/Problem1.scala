//  Background: The TST cruise application receives pricing and rate information from a third party data
// provider. We make two calls to this provider to receive a list of rates and a list of cabin prices. We can use
// this data to solve several problems for our customers. The problem weâ€™ll be focusing on for this exercise
// will be finding the best price for a particular rate group.
// Cabin Price: The price for a specific cabin on a specific cruise. All cabin prices will have a single rate
// attached.

// Rate: A rate is a way to group related prices together. A rate is defined by its Rate Code and which Rate
// Group it belongs to. For example. (MilAB, Military) and (Sen123, Senior)
// Rate Group: Specific rates are grouped into a related rate group. There is a one-to-many relationship
// between rate groups and rates (A rate group is made up of many rates, but a rate can only belong to a
// single rate group) Some examples of rate groups are: Standard, Military, Senior, and Promotion.
